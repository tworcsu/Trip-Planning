1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?

I'm confident that we'll engineer some Java-language software. I expect us to get our assignments done on time, and hope to have them feature-complete.

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?

I want to get better at solving problems well before they're emergencies.

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?

In order to solve problems ahead of time, I need to get better at starting conversations about those problems. This has been a problem for me before, so I'll need to work on that problem before I can work on the other problem. Problem.

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?

Depends on the team and the grading methodology, but I would guess that the people on the team are getting Bs.

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?

Yes, absolutely: that's the point of assigning grades on an individual, rather than group, basis.

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?

I'm planning to commit to six hours a week outside of class. I may be available for more than that, but can't promise to be. I anticipate that six hours a week will be enough.

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

I'll pick the tasks I feel like I can do well and on time, and expect the rest of the team to do something similar. As the sprint continues, we'll run out of remaining tasks in the sprint backlog. We'll be discussing who can do what and how fast during the sprint planning session, after all.

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

That commitment gets added to the next week's backlog, is what it sounds like. As far as no shows, the class expectation is that everybody gets one (if I remember right from the first day).

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?

Either someone is getting their opinion changed or more work is getting done.

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

I expect to live and let live, for the most part. If I have a need that isn't getting met, I'll bring it up at the weekly meeting. Similarly, I'll try to address needs of teammates.

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?

Not particularly, but I'll attend if Todd and Nik want one.

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?

Infrequently, if ever.

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

Not for every decision, no. It depends on how far-reaching the consequences of that decision are.

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?

Depends on the thing, and on how thoroughly the thing has been discussed. If everyone fully understands and still disagrees, then it sounds like the one team member doesn't get their preferred choice.

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position?  How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?

I don't have a good answer to either of these questions, but we'll probably talk about it tomorrow.

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

If by "team process" you mean "task assignment" or "facilitation," then I don't really have a problem with that. If you mean one person seems to be doing all of the work, then I'd talk to my team about it.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

I won't be happy about it, but I'll do my best to get those responsibilities handled.

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?

Email is good, text (at 970-342-7071) is sometimes faster. Noon to 6pm is good most days, later (like 10 or so) on the weekends is fine.
