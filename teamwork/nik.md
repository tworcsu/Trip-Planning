ENTP

1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?

That we create a project we can all be proud of and say is quality.

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?

I plan on being giving out faster replies and commenting more so than usual.

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?

schedule problems, priorities

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?

I'd rather shoot for an A, so I'd do what needs to be done.

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?

As long as they're communicating with the team so they aren't just carrying the group

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?

It depends on the project...I'll do whatever I need to get it done. Late weekend nights are on the table.

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

First their wants then whoever draws the shortest straw. Some mix of compromises probably.

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

Then they are unreliable and their work will fall on the others.

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?

 Helpful criticism is always a plus.

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

Fine. I know my schedule is going to be weird but as long as communication is open and often it's almost a non-issue.

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?

I'm open to it.

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?

No idea

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

Depends on the decision...if it's a group decision then probably.

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?

kick him out...just kidding. Try to come to some agreeable end.

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position?  How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?

It doesn't matter to me at all.

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

As long as they're doing well I couldn't care less.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

Let my team know

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?

Text is always fastest, Email second. Hours are sporadic but I probably won't know you texted if I'm asleep.
