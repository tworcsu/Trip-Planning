# INTJ


1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
I expect that we will complete all projects and assignments as specified.

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication
skills this semester?

I’ve never worked on a software project as a team, so the whole thing will be a
learning experience. I’m sure I’ll be working in a team environment in the “real
world” so this class will be valuable in that regard.

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team
and personal goals?
The biggest obstacle I anticipate encountering is that everyone on the team has
other responsibilities (school and otherwise) and coordinating things between
three busy people may be a challenge. But I am confident we will be able to
figure out how to succeed in this class.

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think
a “B” will be acceptable?
If everyone is willing to complete the work then grades will take care of
themselves.

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in
order to get an “A”?
Maybe. Would depend on the circumstances.

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project
successful?
Not sure. 8-10 hours? However much it takes.

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
I assume we will decide these things as a group. Maybe some responsibilities can
be rotated among team members.

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing
deadline, no show, etc.)?
The other teammates should pick up the slack and hopefully it’s an isolated
incident. 

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the
work?
It should be discussed as a group and we should come to some sort of compromise.

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
As long as team members communicate well and respect deadlines different work
habits shouldn’t be a problem.

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Not necessarily, but if there’s a time that’s convenient for everyone and we
think it’s beneficial i’m not against it.

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Hard to say until we get an idea of the workload.

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
That seems like a pretty inefficient way to do things. There are probably some
types of decisions where all team members should have input but we can’t make
every single decision as a group.

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something? Talk
about it and try to come up with a solution that everyone is okay with.

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position? How will you decide on
whose turn it is to facilitate?
No clue. Play it by ear?

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
Probably let them do it.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are
falling on you? Probably nothing.

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?
What hours?
Text or email. I check both often throughout the day.
